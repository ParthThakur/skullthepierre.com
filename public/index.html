      content='Pierre Miguel Fonseca aka Skull The Pierre is a Dublin-based rapper, producer, and 
    singer-songwriter from Stockholm. With a knack for the infectiously catchy and brutally honest, he specializes in melodic, 
    alternative hip hop, but dabbles with everything from folk to disco. The industrious DIY artist has since 2019 released two 
    albums, six EP&aposs, three singles, and close to a hundred youtube-videos. With his music and art, he hopes to promote genuineness 
    and friendship, whilst documenting his own life along the way. All we really are is just the stories that we tell my friend!  "He" 
    wrote this hahaha.'
