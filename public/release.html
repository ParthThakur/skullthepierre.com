                  In the Quarantine EP, I'm back to my roots. Back in my cozy
                  room in Stockholm where I would lock myself in and write raps
                  to jazzy, old-school hip hop beats. Back then I would sample
                  hidden gems on youtube to make my beats, and I would write
                  songs about my life, experiences, and emotions. I've grown out
                  of sampling, but the themes for the songs always remain the
                  same, life and feeling.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Quarantine EP was recorded in The Lotts, Meath where I
                  spent fourteen days in isolation. My "studio" was an annex,
                  and I sat by the round little kitchen table and recorded all
                  the songs with the mic in hand. Those were fantastic two
                  weeks, full of pondering, conversations with sheep, and lots
                  of music-making. I'm very much an extrovert, but I'm also no
                  stranger to being by myself in a room all day, and so the
                  quarantine lifestyle suited me well.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As I grow, the music evolves, and at the moment I find myself
                  making very different music than what I used to make.
                  Releasing the Quarantine EP is thereby my way of saying
                  farewell to the old-school, hip-hop producer and rapper I used
                  to be, for a little while. IT'S HIP HOP BABY
